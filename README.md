## Documentation

## Networking
This mod is networked and built around Steam, but the networking system can be swapped out using a Networking Layer.

## Modules
Fusion supports a system called "Modules". This allows other code mods to add on and sync their own events in Fusion.
Fusion also has an SDK for integrating features into Marrowâ„¢ SDK items, maps, and more.
